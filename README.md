**ORCHARD - Orchard Sprayer Tower Dynamics** is an easy-to-run code for simulation of the nonlinear stochastic dynamics of an orchard sprayer tower. The implementation follows an educational style, to make its use very intuitive.

## Software History

This code was developed to conduct numerical simulations related to the stochastic simulation of an orchard sprayer tower moving on an irregular terrain emulated by a stationary Gaussian random process. The underlying results are reported in the following works:
